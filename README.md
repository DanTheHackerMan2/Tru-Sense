Utilizes Pyrebase and Spidev

Coded for use in Python 3.11.6 on the Rasberry Pi

If using python version 10 or higher, you will need to modify a file to implement collections.abc as some functions were moved from Python 3.9 to 3.10

Pyrebase also does not use the most up-to-date for their dependencies, so if presented with warnings when installing, please change the dependencies to the version listed in the warnings
